                            After sewing a lot of things for myself, friends and family, it was about time to take the next step. Known under the brand name "Made by Mona Atelier" on Etsy, this little creative project was just born recently.

                            My goal is to create longlasting, useful (travel) accessoires and bags that are still loved in a couple of years, instead of contributing to the fast-paced consumption world.

                            Therefore, I carefully select high-quality fabrics and pay attention to natural, durable materials and designs that are timeless. Adding a creative twist.

                            Yoga is a huge game-changer in my life. It helps me to slow down, recharge my batteries and reconnect to myself in a busteling world. And the good thing: I can practice everywhere and at any time.

                            Completing a yoga teacher training in Pai (TH) helped me to deepen my knowledge, practice in a safe way, gain strength and confidence in what I do.

                            The biggest learning since I started 5 years ago has been acceptance. Accepting that everyone has their own story and individual (physical) prerequisites. Being enough, as you are. Which you need to pay attention to not only while teaching but also working together with.
